Welcome to the IMPACT Attestation Tool.<br>
This tool enables you to attest words by higlighting them in citations.
<p>
<a href="../attestationTool.php" target='_top'><u>Click here</u></a> to log in.
<p>
In the screenshot below you see an example page containing five quotations for
the Dutch word 'ruiten'.

<ul>
 <li>Quotations are displayed per lemma. They are ordered by degree of
     uncertainty about their correctness.<br>
     The most uncertain citation is displayed at the top and its color is the
     most red. Literal citatations are green.</li>
 <li>If there is something wrong with the citation that you can not fix with
     this tool, mark it as a 'bad' citation by clicking the
     <img src="../images/goodCitation.gif"> so it becomes
     <img src="../images/badCitation.gif">.</li>
 <li>If the current headword doesn't really occur in de citation, mark this by
     changing the <img src="../images/fortunate.gif"> into a
     <img src="../images/unfortunate.gif">.
 <li>By hitting the <img src="../images/auto.gif"> button, the word that was
     attested last will be automatically attested in the rest of
     the page.
 <li>You can delete the selected attestation by clicking on it or by hitting
     the DELETE button on your keyboard.</li>
 <li>You can add an attestation by clicking on a word, or by hitting the
     INSERT button on your keyboard (which will mark the first non-attested
     word as a new attestation).</li>
 <li>You can move the selected attestation around by using the arrow keys 
     (&larr;, &uarr;,  &rarr;, &darr;) on your keyboard.</li>
 <li> You can make a group of attestations just by holding the mouse down while
      selecting the words in the group. By holding down the appropriate key
      for LOCATION/ORGANISATION/PERSON>NOT KNOWN the group will be attested as
      such. If you don't hold down a key while selecting the group it will be a
      PERSON by default.</li>
</ul>
